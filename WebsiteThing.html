<h1 style="color: rgb(202, 202, 202);">What I Want to Learn:</h1>

<p style="color: rgb(202, 202, 202);">I am hoping to pursue "ethical" hacking and just learning about technology in general. It is fun to mess around with stuff and learn about all the cool things you can do with a computer. I also like <b>cats</b> \^o^/ .

<p style="color: rgb(202, 202, 202);">I like fixing and modding computers and other electronics, flying drones, sleeping, cybersecurity, and videogames.<br>
    I value privacy (thats why im taking this website down the moment it's graded) and I also value education even though I don't enjoy school.<br>
    I think it is fun to learn about things I'm interested in (duh) and I enjoy rambling on to my parents about stuff they don't usually understand or care about.
